<h2>WARNING: No species assignment could be made from the three gene markers (matK, rbcL and 16S rRNA genes). </h2>
<h3>You may try to lower the BLAST identity cutoff (default 95%) and/or the query coverage cutoff (default 90%) to obtain species assignment results but these will be less reliable.
You can try to manually BLAST online some of the filtered reads to have an idea of which sequences are present in this sample.</h3>
<h3>It is possible that there was an issue during amplification or sequencing steps of the protocol for this sample. </h3>
