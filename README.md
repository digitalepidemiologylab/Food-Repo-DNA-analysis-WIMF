# WIMF description

WIMF (for **W**hat's **I**n **M**y **F**ood) is an open source experimental automated bioinformatic pipeline to identify which plants and animals are present in food based on DNA sequences obtained from food samples sequenced with the MinIon instrument (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). It was developped in August 2019 in the context of the [Open Food Repo DNA project](https://www.foodrepo.org/dna) which is a part of the [Open Food Repo](https://www.foodrepo.org) initiative. It is a follow up to the Food Repo DNA workshop held on May 25th 2019 in collaboration with the biohacking association [Hackuarium](http://wiki.hackuarium.ch/w/Main_Page) and the DNA-based food certification company [SwissDeCode](https://www.swissdecode.com) in order to analyze the sequencing data obtained. Additional food DNA sequencing data from SwissDeCode were also used to develop this first version of WIMF.
